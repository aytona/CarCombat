Car Combat Game Outline
#######################

--Turrets--
Every turret object under the 'Turrets' objects are the turrets.
They are already positioned at the approx. location that I want them at.
I will be adding other special objects surrounding each individual turrets (ex. barriers).

--Hazards--
Every hazard is under the 'Hazards' object, except for the radiation river (located under 'Ground' object, as Ground 6)
Mines - will explode when a player touches them.
Electricity - 2 Poles parallel to each other that generate an electricity particle that the player can't pass through and will hurt them on impact.
FlameThrower - 2 Poles parallel to each other that generate a flame particle that player can pass through but will hurt them while on it.
Radiation River - The river that cuts through the map is a river of radiation. If the player goes on the river, he will receive damage over time while being on the river.

--Borders--
The mountains should keep the player inside the level.
Because I only have a primative car controller, the player can climb the mountains currently(they shouldn't in the future).

--Notes--
Let the light bake. On mine it takes a while to bake the light, which makes the level very dark(I only intended to make it slightly dark).
The big cube at the end of the course is a boss.
Play the game to spawn most of the props in the game.
I implemented a basic movement control on the player for now, will definitely improve on it in future milestones.
Player doesn't have enough speed to make it to the next half of the course, that is because I will be putting a booster at the tip of the ramp to give players enough speed to make it through.

--Player--
The player will have a chain gun as a default weapon.
This gun can be aimed using the mouse.
Another weapon that the player can pickup is a homing missile.
This is an auto-target weapon that targets the closest enemy in the weapon radius. (Used to kill the turret up in the mountains)
